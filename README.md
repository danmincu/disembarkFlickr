# disembarkFlickr
program downloads all the pictures and their metadata from Flickr in anticipation of the removal of their free service

0. https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/? create an app in their "app garden"
1. Get an API key/shared secret combination from your FlickrAccount.
2. Follow the steps.
3. Make sure your drive has sufficient space to download your pictures - only saying that because I have 220Gb worth of pictures to "disembark" from Flickr into Google photos...

*These scripts are a bunch of scripts that help me organize my giant download of pics and metadata (including tags) from Flickr. 
**The code is totally not going to work for you until you understand it and modify it with your own keys and counts email me if you are not a coder and you need help
*** I am not planning to use their services ever again therefore there is no incentive for me to make this program functional for myself or others, I downloaded all my data already let them burn :)
