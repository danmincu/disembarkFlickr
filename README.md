# disembarkFlickr
program downloads all the pictures and their metadata from Flickr in anticipation of the removal of their free service

1. Get an API key/shared secret combination from your FlickrAccount.
2. Follow the steps.
3. Make sure your drive has sufficient space to download your pictures - only saying that because I have 220Gb worth of pictures to "disembark" from Flickr into Google photos...
